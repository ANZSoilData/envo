def: "An accumulation of water of varying size." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ The term body of water most often refers to large accumulations of water, such as oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

Tree cover alone is not enough to distinguish between forests and plantations. The international definition proposed by the 2010 FAO Forestry Resource Assessment: "land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 metres and canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ . It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." - FAO.  2010. Global forest resources assessment 2010, Main report, FAO Forestry Paper 163. Rome.

comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ If the vadose zone envelops soil, the water contained therein is termed soil moisture. In fine grained soils, capillary action can cause the pores of the soil to be fully saturated above the water table at a pressure less than atmospheric. In such soils, therefore, the unsaturated zone is the upper section of the vadose zone and not identical to it.

These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics.

def: "Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

comment: Everything under this parent must be a mass noun. All subclasses are to be understood as being composed primarily of the named entity, rather than restricted to that entity. For example, "ENVO:water" is to be understood as "environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water". This class is currently being aligned to the Basic Formal Ontology. Following this alignment, its definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

def: "A surface layer is the uppermost layer of some material entity." [URL:http\://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/surface]
comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

def: "Silt is granular material of a size somewhere between sand and clay whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.

comment: In ENVO's alignment with the Basic Formal Ontology, this class is being considered as a subclass of a proposed BFO class "system". The relation "environed_by" is also under development. Roughly, a system which includes a material entity (at least partially) within its site and causally influences that entity may be considered to environ it. Following the completion of this alignment, this class' definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised.

comment: A similar term exists in linguistics and mathematics. An ecocline, or biological cline, is a related concept; however, may be better placed as a child of a class like "ecotone". Further, some definitions of "layer" require a layer's constiuent materials to have consistent properties, thus "cline" would not qualify as a subclass. The term "gradient" has been proposed as a more suitable superclass. Discussion in Issue #286)

comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

comment: This variant of the desert climate is somewhat rare outside of Asia. A cold desert climate is typically found in temperate zones, almost always in the rain shadow of high mountains which restrict precipitation from the westerly winds, or in the case of Central Asia, from the monsoon. The Gobi desert in Mongolia is a classic example of a region with a cold desert climate. Though hot in summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of Central Asia. The Kyzyl Kum and Taklamakan deserts of Central Asia and the drier portions of the Great Basin Desert of the western United States are other major examples of BWk climates. The Ladakh region, lying in the Great Himalayas in India also has a cold desert climate.

def: "A material accumulation process during which brine droplets, trapped between ice crystals formed during seawater freezing, form brine channels." [https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary/term/frazil]
comment: A brine channel formation process can be considered a material accumulation process because brine accumulates due to a brine rejection process, a material transformation process during which brine is formed due to the expulsion of salt during a seawater freezing process. This results in an accumulation of brine droplets, which are droplets of expelled salt dissolved in water, which remain in a liquid state due to their increased salinity.

It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

To understand this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t. The containment relation on the instance level can then be defined (see definition):" xsd:string

Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string
