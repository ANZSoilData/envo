ENVO:00000218	black smoker	A hydrothermal vent found on the ocean floor. The vents are formed in fields hundreds of meters wide when superheated water from below the Earth's crust comes through the ocean floor. The superheated water is rich in dissolved minerals from the crust, most notably sulfides, which crystallize to create a chimney-like structure around each vent.

It occurs in fine grained material, such as clay or shale, not in sands and gravels. And drumlins usually have concentric layers of material, as the ice successively plasters new layers in its movement.

This hard rock avoids erosion while the rock around it wears down.
ENVO:00000288	cotton plantation	
ENVO:00000289	horst	The raised fault block bounded by normal faults. The raised block is a portion of the Earth's crust that has remained stationary while the land has sunk on either side of it or has been crushed by a mountain range against it.

ENVO:00000305	peninsula	A body of land jutting out into and nearly surrounded by water.
ENVO:00000306	spit	A deposition landform found off coasts. A spit is a type of bar or beach that develops where a re-entrant occurs, such as at a cove, bay, ria, or river mouth. Spits are formed by the movement of sediment (typically sand) along a shore by a process known as longshore drift. Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped. This causes a bar to build out from the shore, eventually becoming a spit.
ENVO:00000307	icefall	A portion of a glacier characterized by rapid flow, a chaotic crevassed surface, and a pronounced, at times vertical, slope.
ENVO:00000308	dune slack	A valley or trough between two dunes.

When the ice blocks melt, holes are left in the sandur.
ENVO:00000312	sandur	The plain formed by the large amounts of silt and sediment, picked up as a glacier erodes the underlying rocks as it moves slowly downhill, and at the snout of the glacier, meltwater can carry this sediment away from the glacier and deposit it on a broad plain.

ENVO:00000369	brine pool	"MERGED DEFINITION:
TARGET DEFINITION: A large area of brine on the ocean basin near cold seep vents which release methane into the water. These pools are concentrations of water having an extremely high salinity as compared to the surrounding ocean, caused by the motion of large salt deposits through salt tectonics.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: Marine brine pools are large areas of brine on the ocean basin. These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics. The brine often contains high concentrations of methane, providing energy to chemosynthetic animals that live near the pool."
ENVO:00000370	tuya	A distinctive, flat-topped, steep-sided volcano formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet.
ENVO:00000371	complex volcano	A volcano with more than one feature. They form because changes of their eruptive characteristics or the location of multiple vents in an area. Stratovolcanoes may form complex volcanoes, because they may overlap another from explosive eruptions, lava flows, pyroclastic flows and by repeated eruptions, to make multiple summits and vents. Stratovolcanoes could also form a large caldera that gets filled in by multiple small cinder cones, lava domes and craters may also develop on the caldera's rim.
ENVO:00000372	pyroclastic shield volcano	A shield volcano that is formed mostly of pyroclastic and highly explosive eruptions rather than relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano.

ENVO:00000398	volcanic cone	Built by fragments (called ejecta) thrown up (ejected) from a volcanic vent, piling up around the vent in the shape of a cone with a central crater.
ENVO:00000399	ash cone	A cone that is composed of particles of silt to sand size. Explosive eruptions from a vent where the magma is interacting with groundwater or the sea (as in an eruption off the coast) produce steam and are called phreatic. The interaction between the magma, expanding steam, and volcanic gases results in the ejection of mostly small particles called ash. Fallen ash has the consistency of flour. The unconsolidated ash forms an ash cone which becomes a tuff cone or tuff ring once the ash consolidates.
ENVO:00000400	cinder cone	A cone built almost entirely of loose volcanic fragments called cinders (pumice, pyroclastics, or tephra). They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit.
ENVO:00000401	spatter cone	A volcanic cone formed of molten lava ejected from a vent somewhat like taffy. Expanding gases in the lava fountains tear the liquid rock into irregular gobs that fall back to earth, forming a heap around the vent. The still partly liquid rock splashed down and over the sides of the developing mound is called spatter. Because spatter is not fully solid when it lands, the individual deposits are very irregular in shape and weld together as they cool, and in this way particularly differ from cinder and ash.
ENVO:00000402	mud volcano	A volcano created by geologically excreted liquids and gases, although there are several different processes which may cause such activity. Temperatures are much cooler than igneous processes.
ENVO:00000403	shield volcano	A large volcano with shallowly-sloping sides.
ENVO:00000404	stratovolcano	A tall, conical volcano composed of many layers of hardened lava, tephra, and volcanic ash. These volcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic, explosive eruptions. The lava that flows from them is viscous, and cools and hardens before spreading very far. The source magma of this rock is classified as acidic, or high in silica to intermediate (rhyolite, dacite, or andesite).
ENVO:00000405	obsolete submarine volcano	An underwater fissures in the earth's surface from which magma can erupt.
ENVO:00000406	mid-ocean ridge	An underwater mountain range, formed by plate tectonics. This uplifting of the ocean floor occurs when convection currents rise in the mantle beneath the oceanic crust and create magma where two tectonic plates meet at a divergent boundary. The mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean.
ENVO:00000407	subglacial volcano	A volcano produced by subglacial eruptions or eruptions beneath the surface of a lake melted into a glacier or ice mass by the rising lava.
ENVO:00000408	volcanic fissure	A linear volcanic vent through which lava erupts, usually without any explosive activity. The vent is usually a few meters wide and may be many kilometers long. Fissure vents can cause large flood basalts and hannels. The volcano can usually be seen as a crack in the ground or on the ocean floor. Narrow fissures can be filled in with lava that hardens.
ENVO:00000409	whirlpool	A large, swirling body of water produced by ocean tides.
ENVO:00000410	kipuka	An elevated area such as a hill, ridge or old lava dome inside or downslope from an area of active volcanism. New lava flows will cover the surrounding land, isolating the kipuka so that it appears as a (usually) forested island in a barren lava flow.

ENVO:00000418	ria	A submergent coastal landform that forms where sea levels rise relative to the land either as a result of eustatic sea level change; where the global sea levels rise or isostatic sea level change; where the land sinks. When this happens valleys which were previously at sea level become submerged.
ENVO:00000419	stack	A geological landform consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock in the sea near a coast.
ENVO:00000420	tombolo	A deposition landform such as a spit or bar which forms a narrow piece of land between an island or offshore rock and a mainland shore, or between two islands or offshore rocks. They usually form because the island causes wave refraction, depositing sand and shingle moved by longshore drift in each direction around the island where the waves meet. Eustatic sea level rise may also contribute to accretion as material is pushed up with rising sea levels.
ENVO:00000421	wave-cut platform	The narrow flat area often seen at the base of a sea cliff caused by the action of the waves.

ENVO:00000452	ribbon lake	A lake that is long, narrow, and finger-shaped, usually found in a glacial trough. Its formation begins when a glacier moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft bedrock. The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake.
ENVO:00000453	liman	A lake or estuary that is formed at the mouth of a river where flow is blocked by a bar of sediments. It can be maritime (the bar being created by the current of a sea) or fluvial (the bar being created by the flow of a bigger river at the confluence).
ENVO:00000454	turlough	A container of an intermittent lake unique to the limestone areas of Ireland, mostly west of the River Shannon. Most turloughs flood in the autumn, usually some time in October, and then dry up some time between April and July.

ENVO:00000460	penplain	A region of low topographic relief as a consequence of erosion by streams.
ENVO:00000461	pseudocrater	A volcanic landform which resembles a true volcanic crater, but differs in that it is not an actual vent from which lava has erupted. A pseudocrater is characterised by the absence of any magma conduit which connects below the surface of the earth. Pseudocraters are formed by steam explosions as flowing hot lava crosses over a wet surface, such as a swamp, a lake, or a pond. The explosive gases break through the lava surface in a manner similar to a phreatic eruption, and the tephra builds up crater-like forms which can appear very similar to real volcanic craters.
ENVO:00000462	polygenetic volcanic field	A volcanic field of scattered volcanic vents. These volcanic fields, containing numerous polygenetic volcanoes, are noted for having more than one eruptive event from the same vent(s), rather than the more common monogenetic volcanic field. Polygenetic volcanic fields generally occur where there is a high-level magma chamber. These volcanic fields may show lithological discontinuities due to major changes in magma chemistry, volcanotectonic events, or long erosional intervals, and may last >10 million year period.

ENVO:00000491	subsequent stream	A stream whose course has been determined by selective headward erosion along weak strata. These streams have generally developed after the original stream. Subsequent streams developed independently of the original relief of the land and generally follow paths determined by the weak rock belts.

ENVO:00000494	insequent stream	A stream that has an almost random drainage often forming dendritic patterns. These are typically tributaries and have developed by a headward erosion on a horizontally stratified belt or on homogeneous rocks. These streams follow courses that apparently were not controlled by the original slope of the surface, its structure or the type of rock.
ENVO:00000495	tributary	A stream or river which flows into another river (a parent river) or body of water but which may not flow directly into the sea.

ENVO:00000497	rincon	An incised meander on a river.
ENVO:00000498	volcanic dike	An intrusive igneous body. Its thickness is usually much smaller than its other two dimensions. Thickness can vary from sub-centimeter scale to many meters in thickness and the lateral dimensions can extend over many kilometers. A dike is an intrusion into a cross-cutting fissure, meaning a dike cuts across other pre-existing layers or bodies of rock, this means that a dike is always younger than the rocks that contain it. Dikes are usually high angle to near vertical in orientation, but subsequent tectonic deformation may rotate the sequence of strata through which the dike lies so that the latter becomes horizontal.

ENVO:00002230	anthrosol	Anthrosols comprise soils that have been modified profoundly through human activities, such as addition of organic materials or household wastes, irrigation and cultivation.
ENVO:00002231	alisol	Alisols are soils that have a higher clay content in the subsoil than in the topsoil as a result of pedogenetic processes (especially clay migration) leading to an argic subsoil horizon. Alisols have a low base saturation at certain depths and high-activity clays throughout the argic horizon. They lack the albeluvic tonguing as in Albeluvisols. They occur predominantly in humid tropical, humid subtropical and warm temperate regions.
ENVO:00002232	andosol	Andosols are soils that develop in volcanic ejecta or glasses under almost any climate (except under hyperarid climate conditions). However, Andosols may also develop in other silicate-rich materials under acid weathering in humid and perhumid climates.

ENVO:00002238	durisol	Durisols are associated mainly with old surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments and accommodate very shallow to moderately deep, moderately well- to well-drained soils that contain cemented secondary silica (SiO2) within 100 cm of the soil surface.
ENVO:00002239	calcisol	Calcisols are soils in which there is substantial secondary accumulation of lime. Calcisols are common in highly calcareous parent materials and widespread in arid and semi-arid environments.
ENVO:00002240	kastanozem	Kastanozems are dry grassland soils, among them the zonal soils of the short-grass steppe belt, south of the Eurasian tall-grass steppe belt with Chernozems. Kastanozems have a similar profile to that of Chernozems but the humus-rich surface horizon is thinner and not as dark as that of the Chernozems and they show more prominent accumulation of secondary carbonates.
ENVO:00002241	leptosol	Leptosols are very shallow soils over continuous rock and soils that are extremely gravelly and/or stony. Leptosols are azonal soils and particularly common in mountainous regions.
ENVO:00002242	lixisol	Lixisols are soils that have a higher clay content in the subsoil than in the topsoil as a result of pedogenetic processes (especially clay migration) leading to an argic subsoil horizon. Lixisols have a high base saturation and low-activity clays at certain depths.

These vary from soils developed in predominantly moss peat in boreal, arctic and subarctic regions, via moss peat, reeds/ sedge peat (fen) and forest peat in temperate regions to mangrove peat and swamp forest peat in the humid tropics. Histosols are found at all altitudes, but the vast majority occurs in lowlands.
ENVO:00002244	gleysol	Gleysols are wetland soils that, unless drained, are saturated with groundwater for long enough periods to develop a characteristic gleyic colour pattern. This pattern is essentially made up of reddish, brownish or yellowish colours at ped surfaces and/or in the upper soil layer or layers, in combination with greyish/bluish colours inside the peds and/or deeper in the soil.
ENVO:00002245	gypsisol	Gypsisols are soils with substantial secondary accumulation of gypsum (calcium sulfate). These soils are found in the driest parts of the arid climate zone.

ENVO:00002247	nitisol	Nitisols are deep, well-drained, red, tropical soils with diffuse horizon boundaries and a subsurface horizon with more than 30 percent clay and moderate to strong angular blocky structure elements that easily fall apart into characteristic shiny, polyhedric (nutty) elements. Weathering is relatively advanced but Nitisols are far more productive than most other red, tropical soils.
ENVO:00002248	luvisol	Luvisols are soils that have a higher clay content in the subsoil than in the topsoil as a result of pedogenetic processes (especially clay migration) leading to an argic subsoil horizon. Luvisols have high-activity clays throughout the argic horizon and a high base saturation at certain depths.
ENVO:00002249	phaeozem	Phaeozems accommodate soils of relatively wet grassland and forest regions in moderately continental climates. Phaeozems are much like Chernozems and Kastanozems but are leached more intensively. Consequently, they have dark, humus rich surface horizons that, in comparison with Chernozems and Kastanozems, are less rich in bases. Phaeozems may or may not have secondary carbonates but have a high base saturation in the upper metre of the soil.
ENVO:00002250	plinthosol	Plinthosols are soils with plinthite, petroplinthite or pisoliths. Plinthite is an Fe-rich (in some cases also Mn-rich), humus-poor mixture of kaolinitic clay (and other products of strong weathering such as gibbsite) with quartz and other constituents that changes irreversibly to a layer with hard nodules, a hardpan or irregular aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. Petroplinthite is a continuous, fractured or broken sheet of connected, strongly cemented to indurated nodules or mottles. Pisoliths are discrete strongly cemented to indurated nodules. Both petroplinthite and pisoliths develop from plinthite by hardening.
ENVO:00002251	planosol	Planosols are soils with a light-coloured, surface horizon that shows signs of periodic water stagnation and abruptly overlies a dense, slowly permeable subsoil with significantly more clay than the surface horizon.

ENVO:00002253	umbrisol	Umbrisols are soils in which organic matter has accumulated within the mineral surface soil (in most cases with low base saturation) to the extent that it significantly affects the behaviour and utilization of the soil.
ENVO:00002254	vertisol	A soil in which there is a high content of expansive clay known as montmorillonite that forms deep cracks in drier seasons or years. Alternate shrinking and swelling causes self-mulching, where the soil material consistently mixes itself, causing vertisols to have an extremely deep A horizon and no B horizon.
ENVO:00002255	solonetz	Solonetz are soils with a dense, strongly structured, clayey subsurface horizon that has a high proportion of adsorbed Na and/or Mg ions. Solonetz that contain free soda (Na2CO3) are strongly alkaline (field pH > 8.5).
ENVO:00002256	regosol	Regosols form a taxonomic remnant group containing all soils that could not be accommodated in any of the other RSGs. In practice, Regosols are very weakly developed mineral soils in unconsolidated materials that do not have a mollic or umbric horizon, are not very shallow or very rich in gravels (Leptosols), sandy (Arenosols) or with fluvic materials (Fluvisols). Regosols are extensive in eroding lands, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas and in mountainous terrain.
ENVO:00002257	podzol	Podzols are soils with a typically ash-grey upper subsurface horizon, bleached by loss of organic matter and iron oxides, on top of a dark accumulation horizon with brown, reddish or black illuviated humus and/or reddish Fe compounds. Podzols occur in humid areas in the boreal and temperate zones and locally also in the tropics.

ENVO:00002275	technosol	Technosols are soils whose properties and pedogenesis are dominated by their technical origin. They contain a significant amount of artefacts (something in the soil recognizably made or extracted from the earth by humans), or are sealed by technic hard rock (material created by humans, having properties unlike natural rock). They include soils from wastes (landfills, sludge, cinders, mine spoils and ashes), pavements with their underlying unconsolidated materials, soils with geomembranes and constructed soils in human-made materials.
ENVO:00002276	animal waste material	
ENVO:00002277	back-arc basin	A depression in the sea floor that results from the collision of continental plates; the weight of the sinking plate causes the overlying plate to stretch and thin, causing a basin in the overlying plate.

ENVO:01000005	upwelling	"MERGED DEFINITION:
TARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones."

ENVO:01000020	estuarine biome	Expressions of the estuarine biome occur at wide lower courses of a rivers where they flow into a sea. Estuaries experience tidal flows and their water is a changing mixture of fresh and salt.
ENVO:01000021	obsolete mangrove biome	Expressions of the mangrove biome are typically found in tropical and sub-tropical tidal areas, in depositional coastal environments where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high energy wave action. A variety of characteristic trees and shrubs occur here and are able to withstand a high degree of salinity as well as regions of anoxia and frequent tidal inundation. These areas include estuaries and marine shorelines.
ENVO:01000022	marine salt marsh biome	The marine salt marsh biome comprises marshes that are transitional intertidals between land and salty or brackish marine water (e.g.: sloughs, bays, estuaries). It is dominated by halophytic (salt tolerant) herbaceous plants. The daily tidal surges bring in nutrients, which tend to settle in roots of the plants within the salt marsh. The natural chemical activity of salty (or brackish) water and the tendency of algae to bloom in the shallow unshaded water also allow for great biodiversity.
ENVO:01000023	marine pelagic biome	The marine pelagic biome (pelagic meaning open sea) is that of the marine water column, from the surface to the greatest depths.

The oceanic epipelagic zone biome encompasses the euphotic zone and, where and when it occurs, the seasonal thermocline.
ENVO:01000036	oceanic mesopelagic zone biome	The oceanic mesopelagic zone biome comprises regions of the marine water column that occur offshore, beyond a continental shelf. This biome extends through the water column from approximately 200-1000 m depth - the maximal depth of light penetration in all but the clearest oligotrophic ocean regions. In comparison to the epipelagic zone, dominant forms of pelagic organisms do not change very much; however, there are marked changes in species composition and the proportion of smaller-sized individuals decreases.
ENVO:01000037	oceanic bathypelagic zone biome	The bathypelagic zone biome comprises the marine water column below approximately 1000 m water depth - the maximum depth to which detectable daylight penetrates in all but the clearest oligotrophic waters - and extends to about 2500 - 2700 m water depth.

ENVO:01000066	marine anoxic zone	Marine anoxic zones are areas of marine water that are depleted of dissolved oxygen. This condition is generally found in areas that have restricted water exchange. In most cases, oxygen is prevented from reaching the deeper levels by a physical barrier (sill) as well as by a pronounced density stratification. Anoxic conditions will occur if the rate of oxidation of organic matter by bacteria is greater than the supply of dissolved oxygen.

Depth contours, shoreline configurations and interaction with other currents influence a current's direction and strength.
ENVO:01000068	marine streamer	Marine streamers are tongues of cold water that extend > 100 km offshore from upwelling regions. Enhanced primary productivity may occur in these waters as they are typically more nutrient rich than marine surface waters.
ENVO:01000069	mesoscale marine eddy	Mesoscale marine eddies are characterized by currents which flow in a roughly circular motion around the center of the eddy. The sense of rotation of these currents may either be cyclonic or anticyclonic. Ocean eddies are also usually made of water masses that are different to those outside of the eddy. Marine mesoscale eddies are between about 10 and 500 km in diameter, and persist for periods of days to months. They may be formed when an ocean current develops an instability. This instability grows, causing the current to meander, and eventually an eddy is pinched off from the meander.

Currents flowing over shoaling topography such as seamounts are accelerated and destabilised, resulting in Taylor columns. Eddies and internal waves are generated downstream of the topological feature and may extend 1000 m or so above them. This may result in a localised increase in primary production where the Taylor column reaches surface waters.
ENVO:01000073	marine oligotrophic desert	An expanse of marine water characterised by low concentrations of nutrients such as phosphate, nitrate as well as organic matter and, hence, low primary productivity. These regions tend to have high dissolved oxygen levels due to a lack of respiration.
ENVO:01000074	oceanic gyre	A gyre in oceanography is any large system of rotating ocean currents, particularly those involved with large wind movements.

ENVO:01000099	marine surface current	A marine current bordered by the surface of the water column and the permanent thermocline, where it occurs. Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area.

ENVO:01000126	marine sub-littoral zone	The marine sublittoral zone is part of the marine littoral zone which is permanently covered by seawater. In physical oceanography, the sublittoral zone refers to coastal regions with significant tidal flows and energy dissipation, including non-linear flows, internal waves, river outflows and oceanic fronts. In practice, this typically extends to the edge of the continental shelf, with depths around 200 meters. In marine biology, the sublittoral refers to the areas where sunlight reaches the ocean floor, that is, where the water is never so deep as to take it out of the photic zone.

ENVO:01000168	indeterminate root nodule	"Indeterminate nodules are found on temperate legumes like Pisum  (pea), Medicago (alfalfa), Trifolium (clover), and Vicia (vetch). They earned the moniker ""indeterminate"" because they maintain an active apical meristem that produces new cells for growth over the life of the nodule. Because they are actively growing, indeterminate nodules manifest zones which demarcate different stages of development/symbiosis."
ENVO:01000169	indeterminate root nodule active meristem	A part of an indeterminate root nodule where new nodule tissue is formed which will later differentiate into the other zones of the nodule.

https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2	Earth	third planet from the Sun in the Solar System
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2306597	Suni	"""Suni, or Jalca, is one of the eight Natural Regions of Peru. It is located in the Andes at an altitude between 3,500 and 4,000 metres above sea level. Suni has a dry and cold weather and there are many glacial valleys. The flora includes gramineous plants and shrubs such as the taya-taya (Caesalpinia spinosa), the quishuar (Buddleja coriacea), and the cantuta (Cantua buxifolia) which was considered sacred by the Incas. Even though it is hard for plants to grow because of the weather, people are able to cultivate such crops as quinoa, qañiwa, broad beans and ulluku (Ullucus tuberosus). The main fauna is the guinea pig and, among numerous other highland birds, the Chiguanco thrush."""
