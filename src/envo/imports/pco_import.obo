name: population of organisms
def: "A collection of organisms, all of the same species, that live in the same place." []
comment: It is sometimes difficult to define the physical boundaries of a population. In the case of sexually reproducing organisms, the individuals within a population have the potential to reproduce with one another during the course of their lifetimes. 'Community', as often used to describe a group of humans, is a type of population of organisms. \n\nClasses for population already  exist in IDO ('organism population', IDO_0000509) and OBI ('population', OBI_0000181). The definitions should be standardized across OBO Foundry ontologies and only one term used.

name: ecological community
def: "A multi-species collection of organisms of at least two different species, living in a particular area. Must have at least two populations of different species as members." []
comment: Ecological community is defined broadly here, but includes both ecological interactions (inherited from parent term community) and spatial co-existence. It may be used to describe every organisms living in an area, but is often used to refer only to organisms of a particular taxon or guild (e.g., the plant community, the insect community, the herbivore community). The word community, as it often used to describe a group of humans living together, is a type of single-species collection of organisms, not an ecological community.

name: species as a collection of organisms
def: "A collection of organisms that has as parts every organism of given species and no organisms of any other species." []
comment: This term is neutral with respect to which organisms are included in a species. Membership will depend on the species concept and the taxonomic assertions used to define the species. These criteria must be specified by the user.

comment: These relations can include shared values, occupying the same spatial regkion. A community be be a single species collection of organsisms (as in a  human community, which is also a type of population) or a  or multi-species collection of organisms (as in an ecological community).

name: microbial community
def: "An ecological community which is composed of co-existing populations of microbial organisms that interact, directly or indirectly, such that they impact one another's ecological fitness." []
comment: The definition of a microbial species is deeply debated, however, units of phylogenetic and functional diversity are recognised with respect to their varying roles in an ecosystem. In turn, there exist multiple operational definitions of microbial community, such as local, phenomenological, and indexical communities. This class seeks to capture microbial communities in a very broad sense, as collections of phylogenetically and functionally divergent microbial organisms co-existing, potentially interacting, and competing for niche space in the same ecosystem over a period of time in which their causal footprints overlap one another.
